# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the AC Buy application to the Internet Computer mainnet for public access.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy frontend and backend canisters to Internet Computer mainnet
- Generate permanent public canister URL for customer sharing
- Ensure Internet Identity authentication works on mainnet
- Verify all existing features (customer form, pricing, contact page, admin dashboard) function correctly on mainnet

**User-visible outcome:** The application is publicly accessible via a permanent https://[canister-id].icp0.io URL that can be shared with customers, with all features working including customer submissions and admin dashboard access.
