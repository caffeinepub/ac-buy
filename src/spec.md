# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add Admin Dashboard link to the mobile navigation menu so authenticated users can access the admin panel from mobile devices.

**Planned changes:**
- Add Admin Dashboard navigation link to the mobile hamburger menu in the Layout component
- Ensure the Admin Dashboard link appears alongside existing menu items (Home, Submit AC, Pricing Info, Contact)
- Maintain conditional rendering based on authentication state

**User-visible outcome:** When users open the mobile menu, they will see the Admin Dashboard option and can navigate to the admin panel by clicking it.
