  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-47, REQ-48, REQ-49) are implemented in the diff. The Layout.tsx file shows conditional authentication checking using isAuthenticated, direct navigation when already authenticated, comprehensive error handling for 'already authenticated' errors with user-friendly toast messages, and detailed console logging throughout the authentication flow.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Enhanced error handling for multiple error types including network errors, timeouts, and user cancellation",
      "reason": "The diff shows detailed error handling for 'network', 'timeout', and 'User cancelled' errors with specific toast messages, but these were not requested in REQ-49 which only asked for handling the 'already authenticated' error case",

      "description": "Success toast notification after successful authentication",
      "reason": "The diff shows 'toast.success('Successfully authenticated!')' after login succeeds, but this was not requested in any of the requirements which focused on error cases and authentication checking",

    {
      "description": "Detailed timestamp logging in console messages",
      "reason": "The diff includes 'timestamp: new Date().toISOString()' in multiple console.log statements, which goes beyond the requested 'console logging' for debugging mentioned in REQ-47 and REQ-48",

      "description": "Logging of identity principal information",
      "reason": "The diff logs 'identityPrincipal: identity?.getPrincipal().toString()' which was not specifically requested, though it may be considered part of general debugging logs",
