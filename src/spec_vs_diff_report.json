      "requirement": "Keep the conditional rendering logic that shows/hides Admin link based on authentication state",
      "reason": "The Admin Dashboard link is added to the navigation array without any conditional logic. While authentication state variables (isAuthenticated) exist in the component, the Admin link appears in both desktop and mobile menus for all users regardless of authentication status. The constraint explicitly requires maintaining conditional rendering logic.",

      "requirement": "Mobile menu closes after Admin Dashboard link is clicked",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated at the onClick handler for navigation items in the mobile menu. Cannot verify if setMobileMenuOpen(false) is called when the Admin Dashboard link is clicked, though the truncation shows 'onClick={() => setMobileMenuOp' which suggests partial implementation.",
